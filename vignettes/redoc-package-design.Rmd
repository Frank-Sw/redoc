This document describes the general approach and design of **redoc** for
developers interested in contributing.

Two-way R Markdown workflows are challenging because R Markdown and **knitr**
workflows are lossy - the compiled document does not contain all of the information
in the source.  Also, we are limited by information that can be passed via
`pandoc` from markdown to final formats and in reverse. 

To produced a Reversible Reproducible Document in Word (a "redoc"), the
`rdocx_reversible()` format first pre-parses the source `.Rmd` file.  **knitr**
doesn't expose its parser to developers, so I've lifted most of the code for
this parser from **knitr** and **rmarkdown**. The parser captures YAML headers,
code chunks, and inline code, giving names to unnaamed chunks and inline code 
sections.  These are stored in a data frame saved to `filename.chunks.csv`.

`rdocx_reversible()` then knits the Rmd file, using
[knitr hooks](https://yihui.name/knitr/hooks/) to wrap all code chunks in
[pandoc style `divs` and `spans`](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#divs-and-spans).
This differentiates these outputs in the compiled markdown.  These divs and spans
are given an attribute of `custom-style="CHUNK_NAME"`. Non-included chunks are
replaced with an empty raw `docx` element.

Pandoc then converts the markdown to `docx`, and elements with `custom-style` attributes
keep these attributes in the `docx` format, by using the `docx+styles` extension.

`docx` files are just zip archives of XML files, so once the `docx` us created,
A post-processor embeds three files for later retrieval: the original
`*.Rmd`, the `*.chunks.csv` with chunk information, another version of the `.Rmd`
which has been converted to `docx` and back.  These files are available for
retrieval when reversing the complilation. If `highlight_output=TRUE` is set,
the post-processor also modifies all the output styles to be visible.

To reverse compilation via `undoc()`, the `*.chunks.csv` file is first extracted,
then pandoc is used to convert the `docx` back to markdown.  A custom [lua filter](https://pandoc.org/lua-filters.html) converts any track-changes text
to [Critic Markup](http://criticmarkup.com/spec.php), and another lua filter
replaces any elements with `custom-style="CHUNK_NAME"` attributes with placeholders
of the form `[[chunk-name]]`.  `undoc()` then uses the data in `*.chunks.csv` to
replace these placeholders with original chunk (or inline code).  In the event
that chunk output has been deleted, the chunk is placed immediately following
the previous chunk (or at the top of the document).  Deleted inline elements
are not restored. The original YAML data is prepended to the document.
