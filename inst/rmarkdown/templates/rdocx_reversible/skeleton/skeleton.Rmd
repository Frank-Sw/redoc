Reversible R Markdown Document
------------------------------

This is an example Reversible R Markdown document. 

Chunk with code output

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Inline text
-----------

```{r, include= FALSE}
# A non-included chunk to provide inline chunks with values.
a <- 2
b <- 3
```

You can include calculations inline like so: `r a` plus
`r b` equals `r a + b`.

What about empty inline chunks?: Like `r NULL` or `r `?

Chunks with plots
-----------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
